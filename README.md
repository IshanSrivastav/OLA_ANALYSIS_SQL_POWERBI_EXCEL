## üìä Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing ride details, cancellations, ratings, and payment methods. Using **SQL**, I extract insights through a series of queries, and with **Power BI**, I visualize patterns and trends to make data-driven decisions.

## üìÇ Dataset Structure

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **Date**: The date of the ride.
2. **Time**: The time of the ride.
3. **Booking_ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.
4. **Booking_Status**: Status of the booking (e.g., Successful, Canceled).
5. **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
6. **Vehicle_Type**: Type of vehicle booked (e.g., Mini, Sedan, SUV).
7. **Pickup_Location**: The starting point of the ride.
8. **Drop_Location**: The destination of the ride.
9. **V_TAT**: Vehicle Turnaround Time.
10. **C_TAT**: Customer Turnaround Time.
11. **Canceled_Rides_by_Customer**: Number of rides canceled by customers.
12. **Canceled_Rides_by_Driver**: Number of rides canceled by drivers.
13. **Incomplete_Rides**: Rides that were incomplete.
14. **Incomplete_Rides_Reason**: Reasons for incomplete rides.
15. **Booking_Value**: The monetary value of the booking.
16. **Payment_Method**: Payment method used (e.g., UPI, Credit Card).
17. **Ride_Distance**: Distance traveled during the ride.
18. **Driver_Ratings**: Ratings given by drivers.
19. **Customer_Rating**: Ratings given by customers.
